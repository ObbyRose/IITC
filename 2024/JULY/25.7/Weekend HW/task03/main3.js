// ## Questions

// 1. What is the equality operator in JavaScript?
//    Hint: There are two types of equality operators in JavaScript.

// let a= 5
// let b=5
// if (a==b) console.log("they are similar");
// let c = 8
// let d = 8
// if (c===d) console.log("they are similar");

// 2. What's the difference between == and ===?
//    Hint: One checks for equality without type conversion, the other doesn't.
//
// A:One checks for equality without type conversion, the other doesn't.

// 3. How do you check if two values are not equal in JavaScript?
//    Hint: There are two operators for this, similar to the equality operators.

// let a=5
// let b=10
// if(a!==b) console.log("They're different");

// 4. What does the > operator do?
//    Hint: It compares two values in a specific way.

// a:It compares two values in a specific way.

// 5. What does the < operator do?
//    Hint: It's the opposite of the > operator.

//a: It's the opposite of the > operator. and still compares two values in a specific way

// 6. How do you check if a value is greater than or equal to another value?
//    Hint: It's a combination of two basic comparison operators.

   //  let a=5
   //  let b=6
   //  if(a>=b) console.log(true); else console.log(false);

// 7. How do you check if a value is less than or equal to another value?
//    Hint: It's similar to the previous question, but in the opposite direction.

   //  let a=5
   //  let b=6
   //  if(a<=b) console.log(true); else console.log(false);

// 8. What is the result of 5 > 3?
//    Hint: Evaluate the comparison based on the numbers' values.
//
// let a= 5
// let b = 3
// if (a>b) console.log(true) // it will indeed return true but 5 is indeed 5>3

// 9. What is the result of 10 === "10"?
//    Hint: Remember what === does with types.
// let a="10"
// a===10
// console.log(a) // the result would be an equal to 10

// 10. What is the result of 7 <= 7?
//     Hint: Consider what "less than or equal to" means.

// the result would be true as it says less then or equal and it is indeed equal

// 11. How would you compare two strings alphabetically?
//     Hint: You can use the same operators as you would for numbers.
// let a="a"
// let b="a"
// if(a===b) console.log(true); else console.log(false);

// 12. What's the result of "apple" < "banana"?
//     Hint: Strings are compared character by character.

   //   let string1="apple"
   //   let string2="banana"
   //   if(string1>string2) console.log("they are not in alphabetical order");
   //   else console.log("They are in alphabetical order");

// 13. What does the !== operator do?
//     Hint: It's related to the === operator.
//
// A: it is the exact opposite of === and what it defines is that it checks that the value or the string is not similar 
// for example: let a=5
            //  let b =6
// console.log(a!==b) if we will check if (a!==b) it will return as true

// 14. What's the result of 5 !== "5"?
//     Hint: Consider both the value and type of the operands.

// the result would be true due because the value is not similar to a string
// console.log(5!=="5");

// 15. How do comparison operators work with different data types?
//     Hint: JavaScript may perform type coercion in some cases.
// 
// A: JavaScript variables can be converted to a new variable and another data type:

//By the use of a JavaScript function OR Automatically by JavaScript itself

// Remember to test your knowledge by trying these operations in a JavaScript console!
