Today we have an issue integrating junior developers in the Hi-tech industry

I want to make a parent company that reaches bigger companies and fill the void for junior developers to aquire experience in order to advance in the industry and be accepted later in the main company
this company will recieve small projects from the main company and will have a team of seniors that will be taking mentorship of the junior developers and as a team they will complete the aquired projects
in return the company will get government funding, workforce that can advance towards the main company and then they will already have experience and it will solve the need of experienced workers which decreases by the day
what is needed to be done?

-aquire a company that is willing to transfer resources towards the parent company 
-speak to governmental agencies to get more funding
-look for invesments
-set up the code website and pitch idea
-Patent the idea
-make a simulation of the idea to project future outcomes
